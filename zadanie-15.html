        <h1>Who are we?</h1>
        <p>Born in 2019, by the hands of 2 sisters and their mother, GUAJA. is the culmination of a life long dream. Every piece reflects the dedication and detail-driven artistry of its creators, who oversee every stage of production.

Born from humble beginnings at a kitchen table and crafted without external funding, GUAJA has been built step by step, with love and intention.

In its first year, every garment was designed, cut, and sewn by hand by the founders. Today, the business has grown while staying true to its roots, producing each piece exclusively with Portuguese manufacturers who uphold fair pay and prioritize exceptional quality. </p>

        <h3>On a sustainable path</h3>
        <p>We give priority to organic, natural, recycled, certain types of cotton, linens, silks and even some viscose. However, you will also find polyesters in our collection, and in these cases, we opt for deadstock fabrics. Our packaging is made of recycled cardboard and it is plastic-free, as are all its components.</p>
